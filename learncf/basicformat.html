<p>ColdFusion uses a tag based format which looks like HTML. For example, the &lt;cfoutput&gt; tag is used to tell the CF server that we want it to process any CF code it  finds between the &lt;cfoutput&gt; tag and the &lt;/cfoutput&gt; tag. Just like in HTML, CF tags need to be closed. </p>
<p>CF tags also can have properties and values. For Example, &lt;cfloop from=&quot;1&quot; to=&quot;10&quot; index=&quot;i&quot;&gt;....&lt;/cfloop&gt; means to look over a bunch of code between the &lt;cfloop&gt; and the &lt;/cfloop&gt; tags. Start at 1 and do 10 times using the variable &quot;i&quot; as a counter. Well look more at the &lt;cfloop&gt; tag soon but for now, see how the tag (cfloop) has properties (for, to, index) and values (1,10,i)? For the most part, like any other programming language, the thought process is:</p>
<ol>
	<li>What am I trying to accomplish?</li>
    <li>What is the tag I need to do that?</li>
    <li>What are the properties and values that that tag needs in order to do what I want</li>
</ol>
<p>Here are some other key format issues:</p>

	<li>ColdFusion makes extensize use of the # symbol. It uses it as a signal to the CF Server that it needs to process something. For example, a simple math problem is wrapped in #s like this: #5+3#. When the CF server sees that, it evaluates (or processes it) and displays 8. A simple page that does this math problem would look like this:<br>
	<pre>
	&lt;!doctype html&gt; &lt;--- Every HTML page needs a doc type<br>
	  &lt;html&gt;   &lt;--- The start of every HTML page<br>
	  &lt;head&gt;   &lt;--- The top part of every HTML page<br>
	  &lt;meta charset=&quot;utf-8&quot; /&gt; &lt;--- The encoding type that the text of the page is in (remember that discussion in the Introduction to Data Types document about Unicode and ASCII? This means this page is encoded in Unicode-8<br>
	  	&lt;title&gt;Untitled Document&lt;/title&gt; &lt;--- The Title of the page, just like every other HTML shoudl have<br>
	  	&lt;/head&gt;   &lt;--- Thee end of the head tag<br/>
		&lt;body&gt;   &lt;--- The start of the body tag, again like every HTML page<br>
      	   &lt;cfoutput&gt; &lt;--- Tells the CF server to pay attention to this area of the page (this speeds up the process by having the CF server only process the portions it needs to. <br/>
      	     #5+3# &lt;--- The actual CF code that does the math.<br/>
      	   &lt;/cfoutput&gt; &lt;--- The end of the cfoutput tag<br/>
	  	&lt;/body&gt; &lt;--- The end of the body tag<br>
	  	&lt;/html&gt; &lt;--- The end of the html document<br/>
      </pre>
  </li>
	<li> </li>

</ol>
