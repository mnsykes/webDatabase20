<legend>Welcome and Introduction</legend>
<br/>
<br/>
<p>This week's activites include starting to learn a scripting languages called CFML (ColdFusion Markup Language or Coldfusion or CF for short). It is a language which was created here in Boston in 1995 (which makes it a year younger than PHP!) by a company named Allaire. It is now on its 11th version and is championed by both a very active community of users and Adobe, who acquired it when they purchased Macromedia several years ago.</p>
<p>CF is a powerful language  with which is is remarkably easy to get started . The main reason for this is its syntax (or format). For the most part, CF is a tag based language. This means that the syntax looks very similar to HTML with tags, properties and values. Conceptually, most programming languages do the same things even if the way they approach these functions might look and act differently from each other. Almost everything we go through with ColdFusion in this course will be applicable in other programming classes you might take in the future.</p>
<p>This week's assignment is to go through the pages in this tutorial and get the beginning of a working knowledge of CFML. Each page will have an exercise to go through in addition to some background information. Message me if you have any questions or join in this week's chat. </p>
<p>Have Fun!!</p>
