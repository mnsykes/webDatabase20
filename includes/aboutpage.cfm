	<legend>About This Page</legend>
	<p>As we go through the semester we'll be working on a major project, creating exercise pages, working on new techniques to approach design problems and more.  This area of the server is your space in which to work, create and keep your work organized. It's also the place that I will look to review progress, check assigned exercises and overall keep an eye on how you're progressing. Each assignment and project will have its own folder. The name of the folder will be given for each assignment as well as if it is to be based on a previous project that should be copied (i.e. projectWeek6 is based on projectWeek5 so copy the folder "projectWeek5" and rename it "projectWeek6")</p>
	<p>Whenever you create a folder in your area on the server, the item is automatically added to the navigation system on the left. By default, these will open in a new browser window. You can also add your own links and pages not in the prescribed curriculum. In the index.cfm page there is a commented area which shows how to add your own content. Please keep in mind that both myself and the University IT department can see these pages. I only say that so you can make informed decisions about what to include here. If you have any questions, please message me on Blackboard or email my university email account. Student do not have access to each other's folders.  </p>
